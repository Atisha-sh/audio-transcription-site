# Audio to Text Converter
This Audio to Text Converter project provides a simple and efficient way to transcribe audio files into text. Built using Python, Flask, and FFmpeg, the application allows users to upload audio files, and it automatically converts them into text using speech-to-text technology. The transcribed text can then be downloaded or copied directly from the browser.
The primary goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use interface that simplifies the process of converting audio content into editable and searchable text. It can be useful in a variety of applications, including transcription services, accessibility tools, and content generation for audio-based content.


## Features
### Audio Upload
Upload audio files in various formats, including MP3, WAV, and more.
### Audio to Text Conversion
Converts the uploaded audio into text using speech recognition.
Supports multiple languages (based on the speech recognition library).
### Download/Copy Transcription
Once the transcription is complete, you can download the text file or copy the transcription directly from the UI.
### Responsive Design
Optimized for all devices, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.


## Technologies Used
### Frontend
HTML: Structure of the webpage.
CSS: Styling for a clean, user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: Handling audio file uploads and UI interactions.
### Backend
Python (Flask): Web framework for handling requests, audio processing, and serving the user interface.
FFmpeg: For audio file conversion and processing.
SpeechRecognition: Python library used for transcribing audio to text.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/audio-to-text-converter.git
```
### 2. Install Python Dependencies
Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary Python libraries using requirements.txt:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Install FFmpeg
To convert audio files, you need FFmpeg installed. Follow the installation guide for your operating system:

FFmpeg Download
After installation, ensure that the ffmpeg command is available in your system’s PATH.

### 4. Run the Flask Application
Start the Flask server to run the application locally:
```
python app.py
```
The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.



## How It Works
### Upload Audio:
Users can upload audio files through the provided form on the UI.
The file is sent to the backend, where it's stored temporarily for processing.
### Convert Audio to Text:
The backend uses SpeechRecognition to process the uploaded audio and transcribe it into text.
The transcription process can take a few seconds or longer, depending on the file's length.
### Display and Download:
Once the transcription is complete, the user can either view the text directly on the webpage or download it as a .txt file for further use.



## Technologies in Detail
### SpeechRecognition: 
This Python library helps convert speech in audio files into text using various speech-to-text engines like Google Web Speech API, Sphinx, etc.
### Flask: 
Flask is a micro web framework in Python that makes it easy to build and deploy web applications.
### FFmpeg: 
FFmpeg is used for audio file conversion, ensuring the uploaded file is in a format compatible with the speech recognition process.



## Real-Life Use Cases
### Transcription Services: 
Ideal for transcribing podcasts, interviews, meetings, etc.
### Accessibility: 
Helps create subtitles or provide transcriptions for hearing-impaired users.
### Content Generation: 
Useful for generating written content from audio or video lectures.



## Future Scope
### Multi-Language Support: 
Implement support for additional languages and dialects in transcription.
### Audio Enhancements: 
Improve the accuracy of transcription by implementing noise reduction techniques.
### Text-to-Speech (TTS): 
Integrate text-to-speech capabilities, allowing the application to read out the transcribed text.
### Advanced Features: 
Include options to handle long audio files, detect speakers, and perform sentiment analysis on transcribed text.
